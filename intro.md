## Initial Midterm Ideas 

- **The problem you plan to explore, with sufficient background for a Computer Science colleague to understand.**
<br><br> The issue of the Coronavirus pandemic is one that the entire world is not only extremely aware of, 
but one that has greatly impacted the lives of most. With development of effective vaccines, countries around 
the world are working to deliver vaccines to their residents as efficiently as possible. However, every country
may not have equal access to the vaccine, and well-to-do countries may have much easier access to the vaccine than
their less well-off counterparts
 
- **The question(s) you will be answering.**
  - How is the Covid-19 vaccine distribution different between countries? 
  - How do economic indicators, such as GDP  
    and unemployment rate relate to the amount of vaccines distributed within a given country? 
  - How do these factors relate to how soon the first vaccines were administered within that country?
 
- **Justification for the importance of the problem and questions, including arguments and evidence.**
<br><br> Receiving the Covid vaccine is vital in protecting against Covid-19, just like how the flu vaccine is vital
to avoid contraction of the flu. More vaccines will lead to less people contracting Covid, thus dramatically reducing the 
spread. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "COVID-19 vaccination will be an important tool to
help stop the pandemic." <sup>1</sup> However, vaccines must be bought before they can be administered, which can make it more difficult to obtain in poorer countries. As a result, Covid may remain a continuous problem in those areas. Identifying if there is a relationship here could help determine ways to help stop the spread of Covid-19

<br> [Economic Freedom Index](https://www.kaggle.com/lewisduncan93/the-economic-freedom-index)

- **Some ethical concerns and considerations that you already have about the problem, question, and data.**
<br><br> Some concerns I currently have are concerns about the actions that may not be taken if there is a serious relationship. If third world countries do not have easy access to Covid-19 vaccines, it could become another disease that continuously threatens third world countries, in addition to diseases such as TB, Malaria, and HIV/AIDS. <sup>2</sup>
Currently, although the demand for Covid vaccines is extremely high, there are still doses of the vaccine going to waste. These doses have either been damaged in shipping, had problems with their storage temperature, or are leftover at the end of the day. Additionally, is has been found that certain vaccines, such as Pfizer, could possibly contain six doses per vial, while being labeled as containing only five.<sup>3</sup> 
<br><br> The CDC requires wasted vaccines in the US to be recorded by state governments, however these rules are not strictly enforced. If this study finds that third-world countries have trouble accessing the Covid vaccine, while countries like the US have reportedly been wasting many vaccines, there can possibly be many groups that are angered, especially since this is a global pandemic. Personal economic issues are likely a greater priority for individual countries than global safety is, which could be highlighted within this data.
